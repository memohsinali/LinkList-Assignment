# LinkList-Assignment

Implement a class (template) SortedSet which is actually a singly linked list with head and tail pointers. It will
store data in ascending order while disallowing duplicate data. Implement the following member functions for
this class.

Using the last(question) linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a positive
integer and should be taken by the user at the time of the execution.
Hint: You should apply proper checks for the input of k, in case of wrong input by the user display an error
message and again input the k until the user enters correct value.

You are required to reverse the linked list by changing the links between nodes. Now, implement a reverseList()
function which receives a linked list as a parameter but remember this function should not return anything.
